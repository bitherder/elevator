* Elevator

An API implementing the elevator algorithm with the following constraints:

- an elevator of /n/ floors
- an input for all floors can be takes simultaneously either up or down
  - the top floor only has a down button
  - the bottom floor only has an up button
- inputs can be taken from within the elevator for:
  - a specific floor
    - the selection is pending (light lit) until the selected floor is reached
  - to open (or hold open) the doors
  - to close the doors
- an elevator is isolated; i.e. elevators do not interact with each other
- elevator states
  - moving up from floor /n/ to /n+1/
  - moving down from floor /n/ to /n-1/
  - stopped at floor /n/ with
    - doors closed
    - doors fully open
    - doors closing
    - doors opening
- aspects of weight and door safety are (currently) out of scope
